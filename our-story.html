                It was the year 2023 on New Year’s Eve in Chicago, Hannah had every intention of calling it an early night. She joined friends for dinner, donned a sequin dress, and promised herself she’d make it home by 10:30—ideally in pajamas and halfway through a burrito. Her plan was comfort and cheese, not connection.
              </p>
              <p>Somewhere between dancing with friends and plotting her exit, Hannah caught a glimpse of someone—Jamie—shimmying across the room, unaware he’d just become the topic of a whispered conversation. “He seemed cute,” she said offhandedly to her friends. That was all it took. In an instant, the night shifted.</p>
              <p>What happened next teetered somewhere between a rom-com plot twist and full-blown Scooby-Doo chaos. A group-wide operation launched to ensure Hannah had a conversation with this mystery man. For 15–20 minutes, her friends trailed Jamie through the club on a secret mission, trying to confirm his relationship status—all while he remained completely unaware, having the time of his life. Hannah protested the entire time, insisting this was ridiculous and that she had zero intention of speaking to him because this was really weird. But once Jamie finally stopped moving long enough, someone yelled “NOW!” and gave Hannah a shove.</p>
              <p>She was sent flying directly into him.</p>
              <p>And somehow, the moment clicked.</p>
              <p>They started talking. Hannah asked what kind of car he drove (a GM brand—reassuring). Jamie, amused by this woman’s bizarre dedication to auto manufacturer brand loyalty, suggested they check their compatibility on an astrology app. The apps confirmed what we now know to be true: Jamie and Hannah are indeed soul mates.</p>
              <p>They parted ways, exchanged numbers—and by pure chance, ran into each other again outside the venue while walking to their respective transit stops. A few days later, they had their first date.</p>
              <p>While Hannah never did get her burrito, she did get the love of her life. Since that night, they’ve built a life grounded in deep love, constant laughter, and the quiet joy of having found one another when they least expected it.</p>
